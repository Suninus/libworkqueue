* libWorkQueue

This library is a priority work queue scheduler.

Possible applications of this library is prioritizing, queuing, and/or scheduling:

* Queue, parallelize, and/or schedule transactions to a synchronous database API.
* Hardware I/O to a device where commands must be queued.
* Periodic work that must be scheduled every X period for example:
	* A software watchdog to check that your system is OK.
	* A periodic check of network I/O
	* a cron job scheduler
* If you have many threads that spend most of the time sleeping or blocked,
	use libworkqueue to reduce the number of threads and to queue the jobs.
	The result may be a lower memory footprint by a lower number of threads.
